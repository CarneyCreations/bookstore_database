# Virtual Library
Database created using SQLite3.


While creating this database I used SQLite3 for the first time and despite my reservations early on, I really enjoyed creating this project. Learning how I could use a RDBMS within Python was an eye-opener for me and is something I want to use in future projects. Particularly, I enjoyed the error handling with this task as some of the issues I encountered were new.

# Description
This is a library database which opens up with some prerecorded books. The end-user can view the library of books in it's entirety or search for specific volumes using either the authors name, book title or ID number. Additionally new books can be added to the system and new copies can be ordered, or remove those that are lost/stolen.
